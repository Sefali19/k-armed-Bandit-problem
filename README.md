# Gaussian Multi-Armed Bandit Simulation

This project implements and compares two strategies for solving the Gaussian Multi-Armed Bandit problem: Greedy and Epsilon-Greedy.

## Description

The Multi-Armed Bandit problem is a classic reinforcement learning problem where an agent must choose between multiple actions (arms) to maximize its cumulative reward. In this implementation, we use a Gaussian distribution for the reward of each arm.

The project includes:
- Implementation of a Gaussian Bandit environment
- Greedy strategy implementation
- Epsilon-Greedy strategy implementation
- Comparison of both strategies over multiple episodes

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
